While the random number generator is a rather trivial task in Java and Javascript alike (simply importing the Math function), with my interest in design and front-end development, I wanted to create a website that generates a random number given certain parameters. The user is prompted with the choice of selecting a top and bottom number, and the function will generate a random number within those parameters.
