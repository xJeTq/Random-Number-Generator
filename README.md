=======
While the random number generator is a rather trivial task in Java and Javascript alike (simply importing the Math function), with my interest in design and front-end development, I wanted to create a website that generates a random number given certain parameters. The user is prompted with the choice of selecting a top and bottom number, and the function will generate a random number within those parameters. I  used ChatGPT tp aid me along the process. 

Here is the link to the final version of my random number generator website: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xJeTq/Random-Number-Generator/tests/index.html
